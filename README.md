## How To Use

## Disclaimer

Calculations may be a little off due to the constant change in markets.
This app is meant to be used for hypothetical scenarios. For example, a
user might want to find out what the price of Bitcoin would be if it had
a market cap of 5 trillion. You would put the supply in and the market cap in
and be able to find this price.
