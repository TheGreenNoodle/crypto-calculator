# Crypto Coin Calculator

Can find the market cap, price, or supply of a crypto coin based on two other inputs.

## How To Use

1. Open the GitHub-page.
2. Select what you want to find.
3. Type in the two values required to find the desired solution.

## Disclaimer

Calculations may be a little off due to the constant change in markets.
This app is meant to be used for hypothetical scenarios. For example, a
user might want to find out what the price of Bitcoin would be if it had
a market cap of 5 trillion. To find this they would put the supply of the coin into the calculator and then the market cap value into the calculator. This would then output the price of the coin concerning those values.
